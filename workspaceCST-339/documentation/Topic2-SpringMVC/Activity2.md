# Spring MVC Implementation Documentation 
## Part 1: Creating Models, Views, and Controllers

### Controller Implementation Screenshots
We have successfully implemented the HelloWorldController with various endpoints demonstrating different Spring MVC concepts. Here are the implementation results:

#### Basic Route Response (/hello/test1)
![Test 1 Endpoint](test1.png)

This endpoint demonstrates a direct text response using @ResponseBody, displaying "Hello World! - Owen" when accessed at localhost:8080/hello/test1.

#### Template View Response (/hello/test2)
![Test 2 Endpoint](test2.png)

The template-based view implementation shows "Hello Spring MVC Framework! - Owen" with navigation links to other test endpoints. This demonstrates successful integration of Thymeleaf templating.

#### ModelAndView Implementation (/hello/test3)
![Test 3 Endpoint](test3.png)

This endpoint showcases the ModelAndView approach, successfully displaying two messages:
- "Hello World from ModelAndView!"
- "Another Hello World from ModelAndView!"

#### Request Parameter Handling (/hello/test4)
![Test 4 Endpoint](test4.png)

The parameter handling implementation correctly displays the message "Owen!" when accessed through localhost:8080/hello/test4?message=Owen!, demonstrating successful URL parameter processing.

### Code Implementation
The implementation includes properly structured controllers and templates:

1. HelloWorldController with mappings for all test endpoints
2. HomeController configured for root URL handling
3. Thymeleaf templates with proper navigation between endpoints

All endpoints demonstrate working functionality with proper navigation links between test routes, fulfilling the assignment requirements for creating and implementing Spring MVC controllers, models, and views.
